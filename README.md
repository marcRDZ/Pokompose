# Another interpretation of Clean Architecture for Android

This project wants to provide a practical approach to this well-known architecture  applied to Android development.

I pretend to include the lastest features of the framework like [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)  to learn about them by the way and also many other third party libraries, trying to create a kind of "state of the art" app.

To provide a wide domain for use case examples I added a forked version of [Pokekotlin](https://github.com/marcRDZ/pokekotlin) with additional features like **coroutines** and functional programming support through [Î›rrow (arrow-kt.io)](https://arrow-kt.io/) library.

As we already know the basic diagram for this architecture pattern as you had seen in many sites is something like the following:
